## Overview

* The skeleton of web application is made with HTML and CSS, you can check out index.html file src folder and CSS file in dist folder.

* I've used Node.js to organize my .js files in more organized chunks of code, and later to build it in one file bundle.js with webpack node module.

* Main javascript file in src folder index.js imports all necessary functionality from files in models and views folders.

* Used webpack-dev-server to run a localhost app, speed up and test development.
